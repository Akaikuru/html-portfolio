    <h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A recent graduate with a Bachelor of Information Technology, specializing in Data Analytics, with practical 
        experience in data visualization, process automation, and dashboard development. During an internship at 
        PETRONAS Chemicals MTBE, I created interactive dashboards and automated HR processes, enhancing 
        operational efficiency. I led innovative projects, including an Augmented Reality platform for education and 
        a Smart Rainwater Irrigation System, demonstrating both leadership and technical expertise. My ambition is 
        to excel in IT, Data Analytics, and Software Development within a forward-thinking organization. Recently, I 
        completed the PETRONAS BeDigital Bootcamp (Cohort 10, Northern Region), where I further developed my 
        digital literacy and applied the PETRONAS Working Backwards (PWB) methodology. <b>Available to start as 
        soon as possible.</b>
